# About React inside Ember

This project shows how to embed a small React app inside an Ember app.

I set up a monorepo with two workspaces:
- /packages/ember
- /packages/react

Each workspace scaffold was generated by Ember and Direflow CLI.

# 1. Develop
## 1.1 Ember context
The following script *builds the React webcomponent* and *starts the Ember development server*:
```
yarn start
```
## 1.2 React context
For developing your React-based webcomponent in isolation, run:
```
yarn workspace @example/react start
```

# 2. Build
The following script will create a *production Ember build*, including a *fresh React webcomponent build*.
```
yarn build
```
